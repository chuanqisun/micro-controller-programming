# Paper prototyping

- Cut test pattern
- 85% power, 70 mm/s speed seems reasonable
- Iterated 7 versions.

# Scale up

- Learned about "dog bone" joint
- Found simpler design: https://www.ebay.com/itm/405232603666?chn=ps&mkevt=1&mkcid=28&google_free_listing_action=view_item

# Multi-pass issue

1. First pass took to -0.2 inch
2. Second and third pass took to -0.45 inch 11.43 mm (but the stock is not fully cut through)
3. Fourth pass took from -0.45 into to -0.56 inch (14.22 mm) finall cutting through.
   During the cutting, the machine displayed the maximum Z as -0.52. I don't understand where the -0.04 inch difference came from. I believe that difference was why it didn't cut through in the second pass

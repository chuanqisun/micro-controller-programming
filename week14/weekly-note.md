MicroLaser cutting ideas:

1. Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon prism on square metal card
2. A Spectrogram Sound Record
3. A Tatami inspired spinning visual illusion

Prepared assets for three ideas:

- A nameplate for my final project
- Pink Floyd prism graphic pattern
- Spectrogram of Neil's opinion about Computer Science in relation to Computer and Science.

Used Vector design softwar: Figma
Created different layers based on different processes

The spectrogram was generated using a tool I made outside of this class. It was vibe coded with lots of >50 rounds of tweaks. I won't claim credit for it since I've lost track of all the intermediary steps. But it is source available at my personal toolbox repo.

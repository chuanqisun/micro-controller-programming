Machine: F1 Ultra

## Run 1

Laser type: Fiber IR
Dot duration: 770 µs
Power: 100%
DPI: 400
Pass: 1
Bitmap mode: Jarvis
Engraving mode: Bi-directional
Frequency: 30 Hz

Results: uneven darkening on the surface. Laser appears to be weakening near the edge of the board

## Run 2

Increasing Pass: 4

Results: more darkening on the surface. Still observed weakening near the edge of the board, presumably board is bowing. Washing off darkening part

## Run 3 (with real circuit)

Dot duration: 200 µs
Power: 100%
DPI: 400
Pass: 4

Results: smooth looking, but shallow. Copper not removed

## Run 4

Dot duration: 200 µs
Power: 100%
DPI: 400
Pass: 8

Results: no visible change from Run 3

## Run 5

Dot duration: 200 µs
Power: 100%
DIP: 800
Pass: 4

Results: over-darkened, copper not removed, trace appear "eroded" by laser

## Run 6

Dot duration: 200 µs
Power: 100%
DPI: 400
Pass: 8 (repeat 2 times)

Results: initially appear blurry, but after washing off the darkening, traces appear clean and sharp. Copper not removed though
So I went back to run 5 and confirmed the trace was actually good

## Run 7

Dot duration: 200 µs
Power: 100%
DPI: 800
Pass: 8

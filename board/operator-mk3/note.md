Operator Mk3 PCB change notes

- Increase drill hole to M3
- Shrink board footprint, expose speaker pins
- Use vias instead of pins

Learned that vias are too close.

Mill notes:

Round 1

- front
  - x-set: 5
  - x-actual: 6.71|6.67|6.69 = 6.69
  - y-set: 5
  - y-actual: 10.51|10.51|10.51 = 10.51
  - delta = 10.51 - 6.69 = 3.82

- back
  - x-set: 5 + 3.82 = 8.82

Round 2

Calibrate front from Round 1, (5 + 8.82)/2 = 6.91

- front
  - x-set: 6.91
